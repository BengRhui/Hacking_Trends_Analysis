Hi! Welcome to the repository for my Programming for Data Analysis assignment.<br>
In this project, we have performed several tasks, including:
1. Import datasets into RStudio
2. Perform data preprocessing, including:
   - Cleaning and standardizing country names
   - Impute missing value using MICE
   - Perform transformation on skewed data
4. Carry out exploratory data analysis (EDA) on different attributes
5. Perform hypothesis testing using ANCOVA
